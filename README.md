-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
--To interprete user needs I like to try to put myself in the users shoes and try to understand their needs and what theyre trying to get out of the program as well as what I would want if I were a user. Creating user stories is helpful because it compresses down their needs into something tangible that I can act on. It's like having a better insight into whats important to them and how the program can improve.
-How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
--When it comes to dev work I want to take the iterative flexible approach that I've learned in this course and make it the core of my future work. This means regular check-ins, feedback loops, and being ready to pivot when necessary. 
-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
--Being a good team member in software development means more than just writing clean unbuggy code. It's about communication, reliability, and being open to new ideas. Being a good team member and having good team synergy can take a project from good to great.
